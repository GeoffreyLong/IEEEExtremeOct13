A simple substitution cipher is a method of encrypting text by replacing each character with another character in the alphabet. Given a dictionary of words and an encrypted block of text, crack the cipher and print out the decrypted text. The encrypted text may use words that do not show up in the dictionary. All characters used in the encrypted text will appear at least once in a word that is in the dictionary.


Input:
The first line of the input is the number of words in the provided dictionary. Each word in the dictionary is on its own line following the number of words. After the dictionary a blank line will be inserted. All text following the blank line will be the encrypted text.


Output:
The decrypted sentence all in CAPS


<h3>Example 1: All words in dictionary</h3>
